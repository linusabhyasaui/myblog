Project LIDAR is a project I took during Uni with my friends.

The eight of us were tasked to develop an app to connect a mobile phone with an AI processing server.

Three part project consisting of a Springboot REST Server, a Next.js Web display, and a Swift IOS App.

The following are reports on things I did/learned throughout the project.
