Managing a SCRUM project with an 8-member team becomes highly challenging when confronted with unclear requirements and 
a lack of understanding of SCRUM methodologies. The absence of clear requirements hampers project scope definition and 
roadmap creation. Inadequate knowledge of SCRUM leads to difficulties in implementing processes and ceremonies, causing 
confusion in roles and responsibilities. Communication and collaboration suffer, hindering progress. Unclear 
understanding of SCRUM also impacts accurate work estimation, resulting in scope changes and delays. To address these 
challenges, it is crucial to invest in learning SCRUM principles, improve communication, and align expectations for 
successful project management.

As the SCRUM Master, I understood the need to address challenges regarding unclear requirements and limited understanding 
of SCRUM methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, I focused on expanding my knowledge of SCRUM principles, requirement 
management, and effective communication. By gaining a deeper understanding of SCRUM frameworks and establishing clear 
expectations, I aimed to foster a more cohesive and productive team environment. My objective was to guide the team 
towards successful implementation and overcome the project's challenges.

The first order of business was to understand the stages of SCRUM, which were as following:

1. Product Backlog
2. Sprint Planning
3. Daily Stand-up Meeting
4. Sprint Execution
5. Sprint Review
6. Sprint Retrospective

After the proper processes and workflows are implemented, only then is it possible to begin to understand the 
values/principles of SCRUM, which are:

1. Transparency
2. Inspection
3. Adaptation
4. Self-Organizing
5. Iterative
6. Incremental
7. Collaboration
8. Time-Boxing

To achieve a proper implementation of SCRUM based on the principles above, it is imperative that the team has the 
following attitudes:

1. Respect
2. Openness
3. Discipline
4. Proactivity
5. Independence
